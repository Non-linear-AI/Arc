You are updating an ML plan based on actual implementation.

Original ML Plan - Model Architecture Section:
{{ original_architecture }}

Actual Implemented Model (Arc-Graph YAML):
```yaml
{{ final_yaml }}
```

Task: Update the "Model Architecture and Loss Function" section to
accurately reflect the ACTUAL implementation in the YAML above.

Requirements:
1. Keep the same format and structure as the original section
2. Update architecture details to match the YAML implementation
3. Update loss function description if it changed
4. Explain any significant deviations from the original plan
5. Be concise but accurate

Output ONLY the updated "Model Architecture and Loss Function" section
text (no markdown, no headers, just the content):
